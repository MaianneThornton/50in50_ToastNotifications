### Links👩🏾‍💻

## My process💭

This is a simple project that I started by marking out initial structure, classes, and id's in HTML. Next I finalized the UI by styling the CSS. I then added functionality by way of JavaScript to randomly display toast notifications, with random styles when the user clicks the button.

### Built with👷🏾‍♀️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned👩🏾‍🏫

I learned how to create toast notificatons and how to display them dynamically.

### Continued development🔮

In the future I plan on using this knowledge to notify users on the contact page of my portfolio to alert them that their message was successfully (or not) sent.

### I'm really proud of these code snippets✂️

```js
function createNotification(message = null, type = null) {
    const notif = document.createElement('div')
    notif.classList.add('toast')
    notif.classList.add(type ? type : getRandomType())

    notif.innerText = message ? message : getRandomMessage()

    toasts.appendChild(notif)

    setTimeout(() => {
        notif.remove()
    }, 3000);
}
```

### Useful resources📖
